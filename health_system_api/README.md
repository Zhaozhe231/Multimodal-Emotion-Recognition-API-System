## Background

This project was originally developed as a team project for EECE 7205.  
The original repository is hosted under my teammate's account: https://github.com/Evan2001ok/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition-API-System

## My Role and Contributions

In the original project, I was responsible for:

- Designing and implementing the face_emotion module

I recreated and organized my work in this standalone repository
to clearly showcase my personal contributions for portfolio and interview purposes.
